My guessing game guesses a number the user has chosen. It tells the user to choose between 0 and 100 then guesses a random number between 0 and 100. If the number is wrong the user tells it if it is greater or less then the guess. The game then guesses another number and it repeats until it gets it right. It than gives the user a chance to guess a random number it selects.
